Project Quinzical
============================
## Getting Started
To run the runable jar, use bash to run the following command
```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
The project assume `SQLiteQuinzical.db` is in the same directory, if the file is not presenet, try adding `Quinzical.txt`, 
a question set to initialize the database to the same directory.
