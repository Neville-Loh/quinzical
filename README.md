    ├── docs                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
    ├── src                     # Source files (alternatively `lib` or `app`)

The actual source files of a software project are usually stored inside the
`src` folder. Alternatively, you can put them into the `lib` (if you're
developing a library), or into the `app` folder (if your application's source
files are not supposed to be compiled).


### Automated tests

Automated tests are usually placed into the `test` or, less commonly, into the `spec` or `tests` folder.

> **Q: Why tests are placed into a separate folder, as opposed to having them closer to the code under test?**
>
> **A:** Because you don't want to test the code, you want to test the *program*.

### Documentation files

Often it is beneficial to include some reference data into the project, such as
Rich Text Format (RTF) documentation, which is usually stored into the `docs`
or, less commonly, into the `doc` folder.

    .
    ├── ...
    ├── docs                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
    │   ├── TOC.md              # Table of contents
